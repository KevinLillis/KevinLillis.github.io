		<h1>Homework 06 &mdash; Game of Pig</h1>

        <p>
            Pig is a simple one-player dice game were a player tries to accumulate as many points as possible. The
            game consists of five turns. The final score is the sum of the scores from each turn.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            During each turn, the player repeatedly rolls the die until either a 1 is rolled or
            the player decides not to roll any more for that turn.
            <ul>
                <li>If a 1 is rolled, the player gets zero points for the turn and the turn immediately ends.</li>
                <li>It the player rolls any other number, it is added to their total and the player has the option
                    whether or not to roll again for that turn.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            At the end of the game, the players score is evaluation as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Over 50: Excellent</li>
                <li>31 &ndash; 50: Average</li>
                <li>0 &ndash; 30: Poor</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        
        <h2>Assignment</h2>
        <p>
            Write a Java program that allows the user to play a game of Pig. For this assignment you are provided with the skeleton
            of a Java class that contains sevaral methods. You are required to start with this class and complete the methods
            as described below. Here is the class to download: <a href="Pig.java">Pig.java</a>.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Method Descriptions</h2>
        <code>public static void main(String[] args)</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            Your program should include this method exactly as it is. <strong>Do not change this method</strong>.
        </p>
        
        <code>public static String evaluateScore(int score)</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            Once the game game is finisehd, the score is passed to this method. The method evaluates the score and returns
            one of the following: <code>excellent</code>, <code>average</code>, <code>poor</code>.
        </p>
        
        <code>public static int playGame(Random gen, Scanner input)</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            This method contains the main game and includes a loop that executes five times, once for each turn. The
            body of the loop should include, among other things, a call to the <code>playTurn</code> method. This method 
            should return the final score for the game.
        </p>
        
        <code>public static int playTurn(Random gen, Scanner input)</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            This method is responsible for playing a single turn and returning the points earned for that turn.
        </p>
        
        <code>public static void printWelcome()</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            This method simply prints the welcome message at the start of the game. See the Sample Run below for what the 
            message should say.
        </p>
        
        <code>public static boolean rollAgain()</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            This method is used to determine if the player wants to roll again or end a turn. It returns <code>true</code> to roll
            again and return <code>false</code> to end the turn.
        </p>

        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            The syntax for reading a <code>String</code> using a <code>Scanner</code> named <code>in</code> is: <code>in.next()</code>.
        </p>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            The syntax to see if a <code>String</code> named <code>value</code> equals <code>"y"</code> is: <code>value.equals("y")</code>.
        </p>


        <code>public static int rollDie(Random gen)</code>
        <p style = "padding-left:4em">
            This method uses the random number generator to return a value from 1 to 6, inclusive.
        </p>
        
        
        <h2>Sample Run</h2>
        <p>
            Below is an example of how your program should look when it runs. The things that the user 
            types in are shown in green. You program<em><strong> does not</strong></em> need to use any 
            colors. Other than that though, your program should look like the sample run.
        </p>


        <table border="0" bordercolor="#000000">
           <tr>
            <td valign="middle" width="635" bgcolor="#000000">

            <pre><font color="#FFFFFF">
            --== Welcome to the Game of Pig ==--

            You get five turns to accumulate points by rolling a six-sided die.
            In each turn, you may roll the die as many times as you want,
            with the values of the rolls added to your score.
            If, however, you roll a one, the score for that turn is zero.

            At the end of the game, I will evaluate your score as follows:
                    Below 30  Poor
                    31 to 50  Average
                    Above 50  Excellent

            Good luck.
