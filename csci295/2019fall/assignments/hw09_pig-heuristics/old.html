<h1>Homework  25</h1>

<p class="indent">When playing the game of Pig you created in <a href="../HW24-Game-Of-Pig/HW24-Game-Of-Pig.html">Homework  24</a>, there are several different strategies you can use. For example, you can choose to continue rolling on a turn until you get ten or more points. Or you may choose to flip a coin whenever you need to decide whether or not to roll again. These different strategies are sometime called <em>heuristics.</em> It might be interesting to simulate playing the game of Pig using some different heuristics. That is what you are going to do for this assignment.</p>
<h2 class="indent">Assignment (8 points each)</h2>
<ul>
  <ol>
    <li>Modify your game of Pig so that instead of asking the user to decide whether or not to roll again, the game calls a function named <strong><tt>keepGoing</tt></strong> that returns True or False. For now you should make the <strong><tt>keepGoing</tt></strong> function prompt the user to decide whether or not to roll again. At this point, your game of Pig should function identically to the game you wrote for <a href="../HW24-Game-Of-Pig/HW24-Game-Of-Pig.html">Homework 24</a>.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Change the <strong><tt>keepGoing</tt></strong> function so that a turn continues until ten or more points are earned for that turn. Run the game 10,000 times using this heuristic. Display a summary showing the percent of Poor, Average, and Excellent games produced when using this heuristic. You may also want to comment out the print statements since the game will run 10,000 times.<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Change the game to randomly choose whether or not to keep rolling the dice on a turn. Again run the game 10,000 times. Is this heuristic better or worse than the heuristic from Question 3 (answer using comments in your code)?<br>
      <br>
    </li>
    <li>Devise and implement a heuristic that gives better results than either of the above heuristics.</li>
  </ol>
</ul>
