<h1>HW 14 - Measuring Efficiency of Priority Queues</h1>
<h3>Part I &mdash; Implement Priority Queues</h3>
<p>
    In this part of the assignment you are to write three classes, each of which implements the <a href="PriorityQueueOfIntegers.java">PriorityQueueOfIntegers</a> interface.  Note that this interface requires a custom exception. The three classes are:
        <ol>
            <li><code>SortedArrayPQ</code>: Stores the items in a <em>sorted</em> array.</li>
            <li><code>UnsortedArrayPQ</code>: Stores the items in an array but makes no attempt to keep the array sorted.</li>
            <li><code>HeapPQ</code>: Stores the items in a heap.</li>
        </ol> 
        
</p>

<h3>Part II &mdash; Measure Efficiency</h3>
<p>In this part you will run experiments on your three priority queues by adding and removing <em>n</em> items to each, for increasing values of <em>n</em>, and measuring the elapsed times using the Java method <code>System.nanoTime()</code>.
</p>

<p>The the number of items (which we are calling <em>n</em>) added/removed from each priority queue needs to be large enough so differences in elapsed times are noticeable. For each different value of <em>n</em>, you are to test each queue on 10 different data sets of size <em>n</em>. Your program is to generate each data set, which should consist of <em>n</em> randomly generated integers ranging from 1 to 2<em>n</em>/3. This same set of numbers should be used to test all three priority queues for a given value of <em>n</em>.
</p>

<p>
    The results of your experiments are to be saved in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> so you can look at them in an spreadsheet and produce the required plots.
</p>

<p>Once you have gathered the data from your runs, you are to produce two plots; one for adding items to the priority queues and one for removing items from the priority queues. The <em>x</em>-axis of each plot should represent the input size <em>n</em> and the <em>y</em>-axis should represent the elapsed time. Each plot should have three curves, one for each of the three priority queues. Each curve shows the average of the 10 runs for each value of <em>n</em>. 
</p>

<p>Note that the plots <em><strong>do not</strong></em> need to be generated by your Java program. You are using Java to generate and collect the data from the experiments. Your program is to generate a <em>single</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values">CSV file</a> that contains the values for your plot. You can then use a spreadsheet or other program to create the plots. 
</p>    

<p>All numeric processing is to be done by your program. There should be no additional numeric manipulation required to produce the plots. The spreadsheet should only be used to produce the plots and should not be used to do any numeric computations.
</p>

<h3>What to Turn In</h3>
<p>
As with all of the programming assignments this semester, you are to create a single zip file that contains the entire project folder created by NetBeans and then submit your zip file through Blackboard.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to turning in your Java program, you are also to turn in a single PDF document contining the two plots.
