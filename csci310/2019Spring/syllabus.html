		<h2>Class Web Site &amp; Blackboard</h2>
		<p>A class web site has been created for this class. A link to the class
			web site can be found at <a href="https://kevinlillis.github.io">kevinlillis.github.io</a>.
			Students should check the class web site regularly throughout the
			semester. The Blackboard course management system (<a href="https://blackboard.sau.edu">blackboard.sau.edu</a>)
			will be used to post grades for this class. All other course
			information will be provided through the class web site.
		</p>
		
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Communicating with Me</h2>
		<p>You are welcome to ask me questions by e-mail. I will try to answer
			your e-mails within 12 hours from the time they are received. You
			should make sure to include "CSCI-310" in the subject line to help me
			get to your e-mail quickly. I will occasionally send e-mail
			announcements to all students in the class and you are responsible for
			all official correspondence sent to your St. Ambrose address
			(@sau.edu). Make sure that you check this e-mail account regularly. I
			would also prefer receiving e-mails from your sau account, rather than
			from commercial e-mail providers such as hotmail, gmail etc. I will
			try to call you by your preferred name. As a matter of
			professionalism, I’d prefer you call me "Prof. Lillis" or "Dr.
			Lillis". I will insist that we all start our e-mails with the
			recipient’s name (not "Hey" or just blank) and end our e-mails with
			the sender's name.
		</p>
		
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Methods of Evaluation</h2>
		<p><b>Midterm Exam</b> The midterm exam is closed book open notes.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Final Exam</b> The final exam is comprehensive and includes all topics covered
			during the semester. This is a closed book, open notes exam.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Homework Assignments</b> Each assignment will be given a date and a time when the 
			assignment is due. You are expected to complete all assignments on time.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Attendance</b> Attendance is mandatory. You are expected to attend
			all classes and to arrive on time. Missed lectures are the
			responsibility of the student. I will not take attendance during every
			class meeting. Your attendance grade will be based on those days when
			I take attendance.
		</p>
		
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		
		<h2>Make-Up Policy</h2>
		<p><b>Exams</b> Make-up exams will only be given in the event of a
			documented excused absence (for example, medical absences required a
			signed note on letterhead paper from your doctor.) You must notify me
			of an excused absence within 48 hours after the missed exam or no
			make-up will be allowed. Normally make-up exams are somewhat more
			difficult that the original exam.
		</p>
				
		<p><b>Homework Assignments</b> A late assignment will be accepted only
			up to the time when I start to grade that particular assignment for
			the class. At that time the homework assignment will no longer be
			available on Blackboard.
		</p>
				
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
		<p>You are encouraged to discuss homework and other parts of the class with other
			students. Such discussions about ideas are not cheating, whereas the exchange
			of finished, written answers is cheating. Never give finished answers to someone
			else or use someone else’s finished answers. Plagiarism and cheating are both
			considered grounds for a failing grade for that particular piece of work.
			Furthermore, they would weigh heavily in the final grade, possibly resulting in
			a failing grade for the entire course. Please see the St.
			Ambrose <a href="https://www.sau.edu/Documents/offices/registrar/Academic-Integrity-Policy.pdf">
			Academic Integrity Policy</a> for further details.

		</P>

		<p>In determining borderline grades, I reserve the right to consider
			perceived student initiative and class participation.
		</p>

		<p>An incomplete will be given only when a student meets the
			requirements of the latest St. Ambrose University policies. Earning a
			low grade is not a valid reason for an incomplete.

		<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>
		<p>Students with disabilities who believe that they may need accommodations in this
			class are encouraged to contact the Accessibility Resources Center (ARC) at 333-6275
			as soon as possible to better ensure that such accommodations are implemented in a
			timely fashion. Students may also want to visit ARC on line at:
			<a href="http://www.sau.edu/Accessibility_Resource_Center.html">
				www.sau.edu/Accessibility_Resource_Center.html</a>.
		</p>
				
		<!------------------------------------------------------>
		<h2>How to Succeed in this Class</h2>
		<p><b>Attend Class</b> Showing up on time for every class is the easiest
			way to improve your grade — not merely because of the credit for
			attendance, but also because of exposure to the content presented in
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Level of Effort</b> Normally a student can expect to spend about
			two hours of work, outside of class, for each credit unit. Thus a
			typical expected workload would be about six hours per week outside of
			class. This is not a course where students read or write essays. Most
			of your time will be spent experimenting with programs and studying
			programming language conventions and techniques to understand
			concepts.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Prepare for Class</b> Read the chapter sections ahead of time for
			each class. When reading the material, enter and compile as many of
			the sample programs as possible. You may be surprised at how much this
			reinforces the chapter material. Reading ahead of time will make it
			easier to follow the lecture and it will help you decide what to ask
			about in class.
		</p>
			
		<p><b>Do the Homework</b> Start working on the homework problems as soon
			as possible. Often, a problem that stumps you one day will seem
			obvious a day later. You should view the homework assignments as
			preparation for the exams. It is imperative that you understand and
			complete the homework.
		</p>
				
		<p><b>Manage Your Time</b> I encourage you to develop a system to
			actively manage you priorities and time. You should schedule time each
			week to complete assignments and to complete readings in advance of
			class. Effective time management will help you not only in this class
			but also in the rest of your studies and in your career. Poor time
			management and late completion of assignments will be detrimental to
			your learning experience and will be reflected in your grade for the
			class.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Stay Organized</b> Organize your class notes and save all of your
			graded homework assignments. These will be a great resource when
			studying for the exams. Also be sure to keep your computer files
			organized. You will write a plethora of programs for this class; it is
			easy or them to quickly become disorganized.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Visit Me</b> If you have problems during the semester that affect
			your coursework, please see me as soon as possible so we can discuss
			your options for the course. If you find yourself falling behind in
			the class, please see me. It is likely we can work together to get you
			back on track.
		</p>
		
		<p><b>Ask for Help From the Source of All Knowledge</b> There is a
			prayer written By St. Thomas Aquinas over 700 years ago. This prayer
			help me immensely when I was studying for my Ph.D. I thought it might
			help you in your studies as well. It is called the Prayer Before Study:
		</p>

		<div class="prayer"> <!-- Prayer -->
			<h3>Prayer Before Study</h3>
			<p> Creator of all things,<br>
				true source of light and wisdom,<br>
				lofty origin of all being,
			</p>
			
			<p>graciously let a ray of your brilliance<br>
				penetrate into the darkness of my understanding
			</p>
			
			<p>and take from me the double darkness in<br>
				which I have been born,<br>
				an obscurity of both sin and ignorance.
			</p>
			
			<p>Give me a sharp sense of understanding,<br>
				a retentive memory,<br>
				and the ability to grasp things correctly and fundamentally.
			</p>
			
			<p>Grant me the talent of being exact in my explanations,<br>
				and the ability to express myself with<br>
				thoroughness and charm.
			</p>
			
			<p>Point out the beginning, direct the progress,<br>
				and help in completion;
			</p>
			
			<p>Through Christ our Lord.<br>
				Amen.
			</p>
			
			<p><i>~Saint Thomas Aquinas</i>
