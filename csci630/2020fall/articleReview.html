            <!------------------------------------------------------>
            <h2>Guidelines for Preparing Your Article Review</h2>
            <h3>Actions to Take</h3>
            <h4>Skim the article without taking notes:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Read the abstract. The abstract will tell you the major findings of the
                    article and why they matter.</li>

                <li>Read first for the <q>big picture</q>.</li>

                <li>Note any terms or techniques you need to define.</li>

                <li>Jot down any questions or parts you don’t understand.</li>

                <li>If you are unfamiliar with any of the key concepts in the article, look them up
                    in a textbook.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Re-read the article more carefully:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Pay close attention to the <q>Materials and Methods</q> (please note that in some
                    journals this section is at the very end of the paper) and <q>Results</q> sections.</li>

                <li>Ask yourself questions about the study, such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Was the study repeated?</li>
                        <li>What was the sample size?</li>
                        <li>Is this representative of the larger population?</li>
                        <li>What variables were held constant? Was there a control?</li>
                        <li>What factors might affect the outcome?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Read the <q>Materials and Methods</q> and <q>Results</q> sections multiple times:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully examine the graphs, tables, and diagrams.</li>
                <li>Try to interpret the data first before reading the captions and details.</li>
                <li>Make sure you understand the article fully.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Before you begin writing your review:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Try to describe the article in your own words first.</li>
                <li>Try to distill the article down to its <q>scientific essence</q>.</li>
                <li>Include all the key points and be accurate.</li>
                <li>A reader who has not read the original article should be able to understand your summary.
                </li>
            </ul>


            <h4>Write a draft of your summary:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Don’t look at the article while writing, to make it easier to put the information
                    in your own words and avoid unintentional plagiarism.</li>
                <li>Refer back to the article later for details and facts.</li>
                <li>Ask yourself questions as you write:
                    <ul>
                        <li>What is the purpose of the study? </li>
                        <li>What questions were asked?</li>
                        <li>How did the study address these questions?</li>
                        <li>What assumptions did the author make?</li>
                        <li>What were the major findings?</li>
                        <li>What surprised you or struck you as interesting?</li>
                        <li>What questions are still unanswered?</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Refine Until You Have a Final Draft</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Put your first draft down for a day or so</li>
                <li>Read your draft with <em>fresh eyes</em></li>
                <li>Make sure your review conveys the essential points of the article</li>
                <li>Check spelling and grammar</li>
            </ul>
