			<h2>Overview</h2>

			<p>
				This project involves defining a fictional enterprise with various business functions. Students
				will identify information technology assets and functions to support the business needs of the
				enterprise. A qualitative and quantitative risk assessment for a subset of the IT assets will be
				conducted. Lastly an information security policy for employees of the enterprise will be developed.
			</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h2>Deliverables</h2>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw01"></a>1) Group Enterprise Description</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 8/23, on Blackboard</p>
			<p>Define a fictional enterprise that will be used for your group Risk Assessment exercise and a few
				individual assignments.</p>

			<p>The enterprise should be of medium size with multiple locations and enough business functions to provide
				for a good variety of potential threats and asset types. As a minimum, the enterprise must include:
			<ul>
				<li>A cloud component</li>
				<li>Multiple locations</li>
				<li>In-house networking</li>
				<li>Staff working at multiple levels (management, clerical, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				During the first class meeting project groups will be formed and time will be given to work on the
				enterprise description. The final description will be due on Blackboard the following Sunday. The
				enterprise description should:
			<ul>
				<li>Describe the basic purpose of your enterprise</li>
				<li>Describe the physical structure of your enterprise
					<ul>
						<li>Include locations, number of employees, etc.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>List the major business functions of your enterprise</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<p>
				This is a group assignment. The group should work together to develop and prepare the description. Then
				each group member should submit <em>that same description</em> through Blackboard.
			</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw02"></a>2) Group Enterprise Presentation</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> In class on Thursday, 8/27</p>
			<p>
				This in-class presentation provides a brief overview of your enterprise. This does not need to be a
				polished PowerPoint presentation. Just tell the other groups about your enterprise.
			</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw03"></a>3) Individual Asset List</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 9/6, on Blackboard</p>

			<h3><a id="hw04"></a>4) Group Asset List</h3>

			<p>Complete a table of assets for your fictional enterprise. This asset list will be an amalgamation of the
				asset lists developed individually by the group members.</p>

			<p>
				This is a group assignment. The group should work together to develop and prepare the asset list. Then
				each group member should submit <em>that same list</em> through Blackboard.
			</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw05"></a>5) Individual Asset Valuation</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 9/20, on Blackboard</p>
			<p>Using the final asset list developed by the group, each group member is to prepare an asset valuation
				individually.</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw06"></a>6) Group Asset Valuation</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 10/11, on Blackboard</p>
			<p>Prepare an asset valuation that is an amalgamation of the asset valuations prepared individually by the
				group members.</p>

			<p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw07"></a>7) Personnel Agreement Policy Assignment (Individual Assignment)</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 10/18, on Blackboard</p>
			<p>Each student is to create an information security policy for employees of your mythical corporation. The
				policy needs to include all aspects of information security that relate to individual employees. This
				makes it more than an acceptable use policy, although that would be included in this policy.</p>

			<p>There are numerous policy templates available and you are encouraged to study them. However, you must
				write your policy and tailor it to your corporation. The source of any material you use must be credited
				as you would in a research paper.</p>

			<p>Pay close attention to the differences between policies and procedures as described in your text and
				elsewhere.</p>

			<p>This is an individual assignment. As a result, each studentâ€™s policy will look significantly different
				from others. You will have time in class to discuss the policy requirements, however.</p>

			<p>One source of templates is: <a
					href="http://www.sans.org/security-resources/policies">www.sans.org/security-resources/policies/</a>
			</p>

			<!------------------------------------------------------>
			<h3><a id="hw08"></a>8) Final Policy &amp; Procedure(Group Assignment)</h3>
			<p><strong>Due Date:</strong> Sunday, 11/1, on Blackboard</p>

			<p>Your group is to use the individual Personnel Policies already submitted and create a single policy
				that uses the best of the individual policies.</p>
			<p>

			<p>You are to create a Remote Access Policy to cover how users or employees (as appropriate) access
				your systems.</p>

			<p>Create a Procedure that covers <strong>how to</strong> remotely access your systems.</p>

			<p>Both policies must be structured and formatted the same. There are numerous policy templates available
				and you are encouraged to <strong>study</strong> them. However, your group must write your policies and
				tailor them to your corporation. The source of any material you use must be credited as you would in a
				research paper.</p>

			<p>The procedure should follow the same formatting style as your policies.</p>

			<p>Pay close attention to the differences between policies and procedures as described in your text and
				elsewhere.</p>
