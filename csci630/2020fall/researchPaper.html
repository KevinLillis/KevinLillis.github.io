      <h1>Requirements</h1>

      <!------------------------------------------------------>
      <h2>Topic</h2>
      <p>
        Your paper will be a review and discussion of some recent topic in information assurance. The topics
        are not confined to the course syllabus or topics addressed in the textbook. Your paper must directly
        discuss (and reference) at least three related scholarly articles published within the last five
        years from reputable technical referred journals or proceedings from related conferences. Note that
        books and popular magazines do not satisfy this requirement. All topics must be approved.
      </p>

      <!------------------------------------------------------>
      <h2>Grading</h2>
      <p>
        Because of the importance of clarity in the presentation of information, 20% of your grade will be
        based on <em>how</em> you wrote your paper, with the remaining 80% based on <em>what</em> you wrote.
        When determining the style component of your grade things such as spelling, punctuation, and grammar,
        as well as the overall readability of your paper will be considered. Plagiarism will not be tolerated.
        Failure to properly cite sources will significantly lower your grade, possible resulting in a grade of
        zero for the research paper.
      </p>

      <!------------------------------------------------------>
      <h2>Dates of Interest</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Thu ??? &mdash; Proposal:</strong> Your research paper proposal is due on
          Blackboard by 11:59 PM. The proposal must include the title of your paper, an abstract,
          and a bibliography. As a minimum, the bibliography must include the three sources you
          are planning to discuss. Complete copies of these sources are to be submitted with
          the proposal.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Thu ??? &mdash; Final Research Paper:</strong> Your research paper is due
          on Blackboard by 11:59 PM.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Thu ??? &mdash; Presentation:</strong> Students will give in-class presentations of
          their research papers.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Detailed Requirements</h2>
      <p>Your paper should be 5-7 pages long, <strong><em>not including</em></strong> the cover page and bibliography.
        It must be double spaced and use
        Times New Roman 12-point font with 1&quot; margins on all sides. The pages must be numbered. Your paper should
        be organized as follows:
      </p>

      <h3>Cover Page</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The title of the paper</li>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>The number and name of the class</li>
        <li>The semester and year</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Give an overview of your subject</li>
        <li>Define any key terminology needed to understand the topic</li>
        <li>Highlight any background information on the topic needed to understand the direction of the paper</li>
        <li>The introduction must end with a thesis statement that:
          <ul>
            <li>Tells what the overall paper will focus on</li>
            <li>Briefly outlines the main points of the paper</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Body</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly present the main points of the paper as listed in the thesis</li>
        <li>Give strong examples, details, and explanations to support each main point</li>
        <li>Be sure to use strong evidence from your sources</li>
        <li>Citations must be provided</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Restate your thesis from the introduction in different words</li>
        <li>Briefly summarize each main point found in the body of the paper (avoid going over two sentences for each
          point)</li>
        <li>End with an appropriate, meaningful sentence that ties the whole point of the paper together</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Bibliography</h3>
      <p>The Bibliography often gives people problems. Minimally, a
        bibliography entry for a book should include the author(s), the title, the
        publisher, and the year of publication. When including a reference to a journal
        or magazine article, the volume and/or issue number should also be included. Any
        of the &quot;standard&quot; bibliography formats are acceptable; e.g., for a
        book,

      <pre
        style="padding-left:4em;">[BOND76] BONDY, J. A., and MURTY, U. S. R.. Graph Theory with Applications. North Holland, N.Y., 1976.</pre>
      </p>
      <p>or for an article or paper

      <pre
        style="padding-left:4em;">[FORD56] FORD, L. R. Jr. and FULKERSON, D. R.. Maximal flow through a network. Canad. Jour. Math., 8 (1956), 399-404.</pre>
      </p>

      <p>There are numerous technical writing textbooks available in the library which will give you more information on
        bibliographies.</p>
