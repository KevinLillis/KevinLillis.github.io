	<h1>Requirements</h1>

    <h2>Article Selection</h2>
    <p>Each student must review an article from from the <a href="#papers">approved list</a> provided below. 
        You will need to make your selection during the first class meeting on August 22.</p>
        <!------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2>Grading</h2>		
        <p>
            Because of the importance of clarity in the presentation of information, 20% of your grade will be 
            based on <em>how</em> you wrote your paper, with the remaining 80% based on <em>what</em> you wrote. 
            When determining the style component of your grade things such as spelling, punctuation, and
            grammar, as well as the overall readability of your paper will be considered.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            The article review is due on Blackboard at 11:59 PM on Wednesday, September 25. There will be a 10% penalty 
            for each day the paper is late.
        </p>
        
        <!------------------------------------------------------>
        <h2>Guidelines for Reviewing Your Research Article</h2>		
        <h3>Actions to Take</h3>
        <h4>Skim the article without taking notes:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the abstract. The abstract will tell you the major findings of the 
                article and why they matter.</li>
                
            <li>Read first for the &quot;big picture.&quot;</li>

            <li>Note any terms or techniques you need to define.</li>

            <li>Jot down any questions or parts you don’t understand.</li>
            
            <li>If you are unfamiliar with any of the key concepts in the article, look them up 
                in a textbook.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Re-read the article more carefully:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>Pay close attention to the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; (please note that in some
        journals this section is at the very end of the paper) and &quot;Results&quot; sections.</li>

	<li>Ask yourself questions about the study, such as:
        <ul>
            <li>Was the study repeated?</li>
	        <li>What was the sample size?</li>
            <li>Is this representative of the larger population?</li>
            <li>What variables were held constant? Was there a control?</li>
            <li>What factors might affect the outcome?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Read the &quot;Materials and Methods&quot; and &quot;Results&quot; sections multiple times:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Carefully examine the graphs, tables, and diagrams.</li>
        <li>Try to interpret the data first before reading the captions and details.</li>
        <li>Make sure you understand the article fully.</li>
    </ul>   

    <h4>Before you begin writing your review:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Try to describe the article in your own words first.</li>
        <li>Try to distill the article down to its &quot;scientific essence.&quot;</li>
        <li>Include all the key points and be accurate.</li>
        <li>A reader who has not read the original article should be able to understand your summary.</li>
    </ul> 

    <h4>Write a draft of your summary:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Don’t look at the article while writing, to make it easier to put the information
             in your own words and avoid unintentional plagiarism.</li>
             <li>Refer back to the article later for details and facts.</li>
             <li>Ask yourself questions as you write:
                 <ul>
                     <li>What is the purpose of the study? </li>
                     <li>What questions were asked?</li>
                     <li>How did the study address these questions?</li>
                     <li>What assumptions did the author make?</li>
                     <li>What were the major findings?</li>
                     <li>What surprised you or struck you as interesting?</li>
                     <li>What questions are still unanswered?</li>
                 </ul>
             </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Refine Until You Have a Final Draft</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Put your first draft down for a day or so</li>
            <li>Read your draft with <em>fresh eyes</em></li>
            <li>Make sure your review conveys the essential points of the article</li>
            <li>Check spelling and grammar</li>
        </ul>
        
    <h3>Format</h3>
    
<p>Your paper should be 3-5 pages long (not counting the cover page). It must be double spaced and use Times New Roman 12-point font with 1" margins on all sides. The pages must be numbered. You must include a separeate cover page that includes:
<ul>
    <li>Course information (Course number, course title, semester)</li>
    <li>Name of the instructor</li>
    <li>Your name</li>
    <li>Bibliographic information for the article you are reviewing</li>

</ul>
</p>
    
    <h3>Organization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>An introductory paragraph that summarizes the background information and purpose of the 
            research (specific questions the study researched).</li>
            
        <li>An explain the methods that were used to investigate the research questions (use past tense).</li>
        
        <li>Mention the major results of the study (use past tense).</li>

        <li>State what the author of the study learned.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Critique: A Critical Review and Assessment of the Article</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Include a summary as well as your own analysis and evaluation of the article.</li>
        <li>Know the article thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Do not include personal opinions.</li>
        <li>Be sure to distinguish your thoughts from the author’s words.</li>
        <li>Focus on the positive aspects and what the author(s) of the study learned.</li>
        <li>Note limitations of the study at the end of the essay:
            <ul>
                <li>Do the data and conclusions contradict each other?</li>
                <li>Is there sufficient data to support the author’s generalizations?</li>
                <li>What questions remain unanswered?</li>
                <li>How could future studies be improved?</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
