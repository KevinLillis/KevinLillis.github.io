I ain't no Butch Cassidy or Sundance Kid
But I stole your heart with a-just one kiss
You were there by my side when the only reward
Was ridin' shotgun in that Honda Accord
You're my partner in crime when you take my hand
You make me feel like, a wanted man

I remember that night that you killed me
One shot to my heart and I'm guilty
I've fallen for you hardcore
Made a getaway out through the back door
Got your eyes from across the room
And every boy's tryna catch them too
Played it off like I was alright
But that look locked up my whole life

Like I committed a crime
And I was ready to the time
