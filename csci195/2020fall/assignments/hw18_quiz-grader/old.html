<h1>Homework  15 - Quiz Grader</h1>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>For this assignment you will write a program that automatically grades true/false quizzes. Your program will read from an input file with a specific structure (described below) and produces an output file containing the individual quiz scores and a summary for the class. The structure for the output file is also described below.</p>
<h2>The Input File</h2>
<p>Information about the quiz and the answers given by each student are contained in a text file. The program should prompt the user to enter the name of the text file. The text file will have the following structure:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first line of the file contains a brief description of the quiz. For example something like &quot;Section A - Quiz # 5 - Covers Chapter 2&quot;.</li>
  <li>The second line of the input file contains a single integer <em>m</em> that tells how many questions are on the quiz.</li>
  <li>The third line contains the correct answer for each question. This will consist of <em>m</em> characters, all separated by a single space. Each character is either <em>T</em> or <em>F</em>.</li>
  <li>The fourth line contains a single integer <em>n</em> that tells how many students are in the class.</li>
  <li>This is followed by two lines for each of the <em>n</em> student:
<ul>
      <li>The student's ID, which contains no spaces.</li>
      <li>The student's answers which are all separated by a single space. There are <em>m</em> answers for each student. Each answer is either <em>T</em>, <em>F</em>, or the word <em>blank</em>, spelled out.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Example Input file</h3>
<p>Below  is an example input file for a quiz consisting of three questions given in a class with five students. You can download this file to test your program: <a href="ScoresAssignment.txt">ScoresAssignment.txt</a>.</p>

<h2>The Output File</h2>
<p>The program produces an output file containing the results of the exam. The name of the output file is based on the name of the input file. The output file has the same name as the input file, only with &quot;<em>results-</em>&quot; added to the front. The structure of your output file must be as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The first line of the output file contains the quiz description that was read in from line 1 of the input file.</li>
  <li>This is followed by one line for each student, consisting of the student's ID, followed by a colon, a single space, and the number of correct answers.</li>
  <li>At the end of the output file there is one additional line containing the class average. This line contains the words <em>Class Average</em>, followed by a colon, a single space, and the average number of correct answers, which is a floating point number.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example Output File</h3>
<p>Below is  the output file produced when the program is executed with the example input file shown above. You can also download this file: <a href="results-ScoresAssignment.txt">results-ScoresAssignment.txt</a></p>
<pre><strong>    Section A - Quiz # 5 - Covers Chapter 2
    GHBT339294: 3
    ts3390493: 2
    Baker123: 0
    Steiner: 3
    2983: 3
    Class Average: 2.2</strong></pre>
