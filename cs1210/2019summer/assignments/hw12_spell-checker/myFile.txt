This is a sample file showing how the spell checker should work.

Color of words that are not spelled correctly
These words are rendered in red.

Things not in the dictionary:
There are many things that aren't in our dictionary. These include plurals, contractions, and other things. That's OK for this assignment.

Spacing on a line:
White space on a single line is always shown as a single space in the output file. For example:
Here are three spaces:   Next we have a single tab character:	Notice that the white space shows up as a single space.

Case:
When a word is looked up in the dictionary file, it is first converted to lower case. However, the original word, with the case in tact, is used. That is why the first word of each sentence has an upper case letter. This also makes proper names, like Kramden and Iowa, and ALL CAPS work correctly.

Word with a digit:
If a word has a digit in it, the word is automatically considered correct. So BIX7 is seen as correct. We can also use this to enter a phone number, like 555-1212.

Punctuation:
Notice that the last word in a sentence is considered independently of the punctuation character. So if the last word in a sentence is misspelled, only the word itself is colored red, not the punctuation. In fact, this is true for any word followed by a punctuation character. Here is an example:

This sentenc, in addition to having poor grammar, has some misspelled wrods!.?, Do you think it works with a question mark aslo?

Word Replacement:
The spell checker does some auto replacement. Each word that is replaced is colored blue. Can you tell what teh worng word was in this sentence?
