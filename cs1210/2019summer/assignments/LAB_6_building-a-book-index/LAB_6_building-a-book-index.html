<h1>Week 6 Lab &mdash; Building a Book Index</h1>

<p>If you flip to the back of our textbook you will find the index, which consists of an alphabetical list of terms. Following each term is a list of page numbers, given in order, where the term appears. To build such an index, someone must go through the book and record which terms appear on which pages. Let's assume they record this information in a text file called <a href="terms.txt">terms.txt</a>. Below is an example of what this file might contain.</p>
    
<p><pre style="padding-left: 4em">
3:degree
4:vertex
54:connected
93:adjacent
54:vertex
40:vertex
19:edge
64:neighbor
72:path
55:shortest path
127:tree
99:spanning tree
19:path
30:vertex
28:connected
3:degree
55:graph
64:adjacent
44:breadth first search
77:neighbor
55:degree
3:vertex
55:depth first search
19:degree
27:neighbor
16:Spanning Tree
</pre></p>
    
<p>With this example file, the following index would be created:</p>

<p><pre  style="padding-left: 4em">
adjacent, 64, 93
breadth first search, 44
connected, 28, 54
degree, 3, 19, 55
depth first search, 55
edge, 19
graph, 55
neighbor, 27, 64, 77
path, 19, 72
shortest path, 55
spanning tree, 16, 99
tree, 127
vertex, 3, 4, 30, 40, 54    
</pre></p>

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>Write a program that reads the terms from an input file called <code>terms.txt</code> (formatted as shown above) and displays the associated index (formatted as shown above).</p>
