        <h2>General Catalog</h2>
        <p>Introduction to programming using Python; programming constructs, data types, problem-solving strategies, data structures, object-oriented programming.</p>
    <h2>Course Description</h2>		
    <p>
This is the introduction-to-programming course in the computer science major and minor curricula. Prior programming experience is not required, although some students will have had some previous exposure to programming. It emphasizes object-oriented programming style and methodology. The lecture is taught three times a week. The 50-minute discussion periods, led by a TA, are used to discuss programming exercises, hold quizzes, and to answer questions in a small classroom atmosphere. Concepts are presented in the context of working examples and exercises. Language syntax and computing paradigms are studied. Programming projects are used to reinforce key programming notions, including iteration, data types, functions, and objects. Projects may include graphics, string processing, and network applications. Lectures are taught by a faculty member; discussion sections are led by TAs.</p>

    <h2>Class Web Site &amp; ICON</h2>
    <p>A class web site has been created for this class. A link to the class web site can be found at <a href="https://kevinlillis.github.io">https://kevinlillis.github.io</a>. Students should check the class web site regularly throughout the semester. The <a href="https://icon.uiowa.edu">ICON</a> course management system
(<a href="https://icon.uiowa.edu">icon.uiowa.edu</a>) will be used for homework submission and to post grades. All other course information will be provided through the class web site.</p>
    
<!------------------------------------------------------>
    <h2>Communicating with Me</h2>
    <p>The TA is the best &quot;first line of defense&quot; for questions and programming help. If you have problems during the
semester that affect your coursework, please see your TA as soon as possible.</p>

	<p>You are welcome to email me with questions relating to this course. I will attempt to respond within 12 hours of email receipt. Make sure to include CS:1210 in the subject line to help me get to your email quickly. I will occasionally send email announcements to all students in the class and you are responsible for all official correspondence sent to the UI address (@uiowa.edu). Make sure that you check this email account regularly. I would also prefer receiving emails from your uiowa account, rather than from commercial email providers such as hotmail, gmail etc. I will try to call you by your preferred name. As a matter of professionalism, I’d prefer you call me "Prof. Lillis" or "Dr. Lillis". I will insist that we all start our emails with the recipient’s name (not "Hey" or just blank) and end our emails with the sender's name.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>
    <h2>Methods of Evaluation</h2>
    <p>There will be a comprehensive final exam, periodic quizzes, and regular lab and homework assignments.</p>

    <p><b>Final Exam</b> The final exam is a comprehensive exam including all topics covered. This is a closed book and open notes exam. The final exam will be from 10:00 &mdash; noon on Friday, 8/2, in room 40 of <a href="https://maps.uiowa.edu/sh">Schaeffer Hall</a>.</p>
    
    <p><b>Quizzes</b> There will be several quizzes throughout the course. Quizzes are closed book and closed notes and may or may not be announced in advanced. The lowest quiz will be dropped when computing your final grade for the class.</p>
    
    <p><b>Homework Assignments</b> Each Homework Assignment will be given a date and a time when the assignment is due. You are expected to complete all assignments on time. Homework Assignments will normally be turned in through <a href="https://icon.uiowa.edu">ICON</a>. Homework assignments are not collaborative. Each student is expected to work independently to complete all homework assignments. Homework assignments are normally worth 10 points and are graded according to the <a href="rubric.html">Grading Rubric for Programming Assignment</a>.</p>
    
<p><b>Lab Assignments</b> Lab assignments are completed in-class during your discussion section. Each lab assignment is worth 2 points and is graded as follows:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>2 Points for a correct program</li>
      <li>1 Point for any reasonable attempt</li>
      <li>0 Points for no attempt</li>
    </ul>
</p>    

<!------------------------------------------------------>
    <h2>Make-Up Policy</h2>
    <p><b>Final Exam</b> There will be no make-up exams in general and exceptions will be rare and only
for students whose reasons are included in the University’s policy on &quot;Excused Absences from Examinations&quot;
(<a href="http://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/attendance-absences">clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/attendance-absences</a>).

    <p><b>Quizzes</b> Quizzes cannot be made up. You must be present in class on the day of the quiz in order to receive credit for the quiz.</p>

    <p><b>Homework Assignments</b> Homework assignments will be accepted only up to the time when grading for that particular assignment has begun. At that time, the  assignment will no longer be available for submission through <a href="https://icon.uiowa.edu">ICON</a>.</p>
    
    <p><b>Lab Assignments</b> Lab assignments must be turned in before the end of the discussion section. No Lab Assignments will be accepted after that.</p>

		</P>

		<p>In determining borderline grades, I reserve the right to consider
			perceived student initiative and class participation.
		</p>
        
        <p>A grade of A+ is given only in extraordinary situations.
        </p>

		<p>An incomplete will be given only when a student meets the
			requirements of the latest St. Ambrose University policies. Earning a
			low grade is not a valid reason for an incomplete.

    <h2>How to Succeed in this Class</h2>
    <p><b>Attend Class</b> Showing up on time for every class is the easiest way to improve your grade.</p>
    
    <p><b>Level of Effort</b> Normally a student can expect to spend about two hours of work, outside of class, for each credit unit. Thus a typical expected workload would be about eight hours per week <em>outside</em> of class. This is not a course where students read or write essays. Most of your time will be spent experimenting with programs and studying programming language conventions and techniques to understand concepts.</p>
    
    <p><b>Prepare for Class</b> Read the chapter sections ahead of time for each class (they are posted on the class web site.) When reading the textbook, enter and run as many of the sample programs as possible. You may be surprised at how much this reinforces the chapter material. Reading ahead of time will make it easier to follow the lecture and it will help you decide what to ask about in class. Unless asked, I will not repeat material in class that you could have learned by reading.</p>
    
    <p><b>Do the Homework</b> Start working on the homework problems as soon as possible. Often, a problem that stumps you one day will seem obvious a day later. You should view the homework assignments as preparation for the exams. It is imperative that you understand and complete the homework.</p>
    
<p><b>Do Your Own Work</b> You are encouraged to discuss homework and other parts of the class with other students. Such discussions about ideas are not cheating, whereas the exchange of finished, written answers is cheating. Never give finished answers to someone else or use someone else’s finished answers. Plagiarism and cheating are both considered grounds for a failing grade for that particular piece of work. Furthermore, they would weigh heavily in the final grade, possibly resulting in a failing grade for the entire course.</p>    
    
    <p><b>Manage Your Time</b> I encourage you to develop a system to actively manage you priorities and time. You should schedule time each week to complete assignments and to complete readings in advance of class. Effective time management will help you not only in this class but also in the rest of your studies and in your career. Poor time management and late completion of assignments will be detrimental to your learning experience and will be reflected in your grade for the class.</p>
    
    <p><b>Stay Organized</b> Organize your class notes and save all of your graded homework assignments. These will be a great resource when studying for the exams. Also be sure to keep your computer files organized. You will write a plethora of programs for this class; it is easy for them to quickly become disorganized.</p>
    
    <p><b>Visit Me or Our TA</b> If you have problems during the semester that affect your coursework, please see me or our TA as soon as possible so we can discuss your options for the course. If you find yourself falling behind in the class, please see me! It is likely we can work together to get you back on track.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>
	<h2>Course Accounts</h2>
    <p>You will need CS course accounts to do and submit your work for the course. Some of you may already have such accounts; the rest of you will get CS accounts by the end of the first week. You will also need a HawkID and a password to login to <a href="https://icon.uiowa.edu">ICON</a> to electronically submit your assigned work.</p>

<!------------------------------------------------------>    
	<h2>The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences Policies and Procedures</h2>
    
<p><b>Administrative Home</b>
The College of Liberal Arts and Sciences is the administrative home of this course and governs matters such as the add/drop deadlines, the second-grade-only option, and other related issues. Different colleges may have different policies. Questions may be addressed to 120 Schaeffer Hall, or see the CLAS <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook">Academic Policies Handbook</a>.</p>

<p><b>Electronic Communication</b>
University policy specifies that students are responsible for all official correspondences sent to their University of Iowa e-mail address (@uiowa.edu). Faculty and students should use this account for correspondence <a href="https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/human-resources/professional-ethics-and-academic-responsibility#15.2">(Operations Manual, III.15.2.</a> Scroll down to k.11).</p>

<p><b>Accommodations for Disabilities</b>
A student seeking academic accommodations should first register with Student Disability Services and then meet with the course instructor privately in the instructor's office to make particular arrangements. See <a href="https://sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu/">sds.studentlife.uiowa.edu</a> for more information.</p>

<p><b>Nondiscrimination in the Classroom</b>
The University of Iowa is committed to making the classroom a respectful and inclusive space for all people irrespective of their gender, sexual, racial, religious or other identities. Toward this goal, students are invited to optionally share their preferred names and pronouns with their instructors and classmates. The University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment against individuals on the basis of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and other identity categories set forth in the University’s Human Rights policy. For more information, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity, <a href="mailto:diversity@uiowa.edu">diversity@uiowa.edu</a>, or visit <a href="https://diversity.uiowa.edu/">diversity.uiowa.edu</a>.</p>

<p><b>Academic Honesty</b>
All  students taking CLAS courses have, in essence, agreed to the College's <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code">Code of Academic Honesty</a>: "I pledge to do my own academic work and to excel to the best of my abilities, upholding the <a href="https://newstudents.uiowa.edu/iowa-challenge">IOWA Challenge</a>. I promise not to lie about my academic work, to cheat, or to steal the words or ideas of others; nor will I help fellow students to violate the Code of Academic Honesty." Any student committing academic misconduct is reported to the College and placed on disciplinary probation or may be suspended or expelled (CLAS <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/academic-fraud-honor-code">Academic Policies Handbook</a>).</p>


<p><b>CLAS Final Examination Policies</b>
The date and time of every final examination is announced  by the Registrar generally by the fifth week of classes.  No exams of any kind are allowed during the last week of classes. All students should plan on being at the UI through the final examination period. It is the student's responsibility to know the date, time, and place of the final exam.
</p>

<p><b>Making a Suggestion or a Complaint</b>
Students with a suggestion or complaint should first visit with the instructor (and the course supervisor), and then with the departmental DEO. Complaints must be made within six months of the incident (CLAS <a href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities#rights">Academic Policies Handbook</a>).</p>

<p><b>Understanding Sexual Harassment</b>
Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students, faculty, and staff. All members of the UI community have a responsibility to uphold this mission and to contribute to a safe environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual harassment should be reported immediately. See the <a href="https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/">Office of the Sexual Misconduct Response Coordinator</a> for assistance, definitions, and the full University policy.</p>

<p><b>Reacting Safely to Severe Weather</b>
In severe weather, class members should seek appropriate shelter immediately, leaving the classroom if necessary. The class will continue if possible when the event is over. For more information on Hawk Alert and the siren warning system, visit the <a href="https://police.uiowa.edu/emergency-communications">Public Safety website</a>.</p>
