			<h2>Course Description <span style="font-size:50%;">(see <a target="_blank"
						href="https://cs.uiowa.edu/resources/course-descriptions">CS Course Descriptions</a>)</span>
			</h2>
			<p>
				This is the introduction to programming course in the computer science major and minor curriculum. Prior
				programming experience is not required, although some students have had some previous exposure to
				programming. It emphasizes object oriented programming style and methodology. The lecture is taught
				three times a week. The 50-minute discussion periods, led by a TA, are used to discuss programming
				exercises, and to answer questions in a small classroom atmosphere. Concepts are presented in the
				context of working examples and exercises. Language syntax and computing paradigms are studied.
				Programming projects are used to reinforce key programming notions, including iteration, data types,
				functions, and objects. Projects may include graphics, string processing, and network applications.
				Lectures are taught by a faculty member; discussion sections are led by TAs.

			<h2>How to Succeed in this Class</h2>
			<p><strong>Attend Online Classes</strong> Showing up on time for every class is the easiest way to improve
				your grade.</p>

			<p><strong>Level of Effort</strong> Normally a student can expect to spend about two hours of work, outside
				of class, for each credit unit. Thus a typical expected workload would be about eight hours per week
				<em>outside</em> of class. This is not a course where students read or write essays. Most of your time
				will be spent experimenting with programs and studying programming language conventions and techniques
				to understand concepts.</p>

			<p><strong>Prepare for Class</strong> Read the chapter sections ahead of time for each class (they are
				posted on the class web site.) When reading the textbook, enter and run as many of the sample programs
				as possible. You may be surprised at how much this reinforces the chapter material. Reading ahead of
				time will make it easier to follow the lecture and it will help you decide what to ask about in class.
				Unless asked, I will not repeat material in class that you could have learned by reading.</p>

			<p><strong>Do the Homework</strong> Start working on the homework problems as soon as possible. Often, a
				problem that stumps you one day will seem obvious a day later. You should view the homework assignments
				as preparation for the exams. It is imperative that you understand and complete the homework.</p>

			<p><strong>Do Your Own Work</strong> You are encouraged to discuss homework and other parts of the class
				with other students. Such discussions about ideas are not cheating, whereas the exchange of finished,
				written answers is cheating. Never give finished answers to someone else or use another person's
				finished answers. Plagiarism and cheating are both considered grounds for a failing grade for that
				particular piece of work. Furthermore, they would weigh heavily in the final grade, possibly resulting
				in a failing grade for the entire course.</p>

			<p><strong>Manage Your Time</strong> I encourage you to develop a system to actively manage you priorities
				and time. You should schedule time each week to complete assignments and to complete readings in advance
				of class. Effective time management will help you not only in this class but also in the rest of your
				studies and in your career. Poor time management and late completion of assignments will be detrimental
				to your learning experience and will be reflected in your grade for the class.</p>

			<p><strong>Stay Organized</strong> Organize your class notes and save all of your graded homework
				assignments. These will be a great resource when studying for the exams. Also be sure to keep your
				computer files organized. You will write a plethora of programs for this class; it is easy for them to
				quickly become disorganized.</p>

			<p><strong> Visit With Me or Our TA</strong> If you have problems during the semester that affect your
				coursework, please see me or our TA as soon as possible so we can discuss your options for the course.
				If you find yourself falling behind in the class, please see me! It is likely we can work together to
				get you back on track.

			<p><strong>Communication and the Required Use of UI Email</strong>
				Students are responsible for official correspondences sent to the UI email address (uiowa.edu) and
				must

					href="https://opsmanual.uiowa.edu/human-resources/professional-ethics-and-academic-responsibility#15.2">Operations
					Manual, III.15.2</a>).</p>

			<p><strong>Complaints</strong>
				Students with a complaint about an academic issue should first visit with the instructor or course
				supervisor and then with the Chair of the department or program offering the course; students may
				next bring the issue to the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. For more information, see <a
					target="_blank"
					href="https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities">https://clas.uiowa.edu/students/handbook/student-rights-responsibilities</a>.
			</p>

			<p><strong>Final Examination Policies</strong>
				The final exam schedule is announced around the fifth week of classes; students are responsible for
				knowing the date, time, and place of a final exam. Students should not make travel plans until
				knowing
				this information. No exams of any kind are allowed the week before finals. Visit <a target="_blank"

			<p><strong>Nondiscrimination in the Classroom</strong>
				UI is committed to making the classroom a respectful and inclusive space for all people irrespective
				of
				their gender, sexual, racial, religious or other identities. Toward this goal, students are invited
				to
				optionally share their preferred names and pronouns with their instructors and classmates. The
				University of Iowa prohibits discrimination and harassment against individuals on the basis of
				race, class, gender, sexual orientation, national origin, and other identity categories set forth
				in the University’s Human Rights policy. For more information, contact the Office of Equal
				Opportunity
				and Diversity (<a target="_blank"

			</p>

			<p><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong>
				Sexual harassment subverts the mission of the University and threatens the well-being of students,
				faculty, and staff. All members of the UI community must uphold the UI mission and contribute to a
				safe
				environment that enhances learning. Incidents of sexual harassment must be reported immediately. For
				assistance, please see <a target="_blank" href="https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/">https://osmrc.uiowa.edu/</a>.
