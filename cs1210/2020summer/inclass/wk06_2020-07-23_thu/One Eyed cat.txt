You gave up your one-eyed cat,
still makes you sad, but i'm allergic

You gave up trips to the beach,
you used to go every week to get some surfing

You cut back on a daily routine of chocolate ice cream and three french presses
You gave up playing solo gigs to sing with me, we sound much better

I didn't mind much giving it up, cause i got even more of you...

Honey, know i meant it when i said i do
Long as i'm alive i'll fancy you
And our love may not look much like hollywood's
But i'll love you with all my heart (by grace)

You gave me a diamond ring, on your knee in a puddle
You gave me your hand and trust, your very love and that was crazy
You gave me your confidence of faithfulness, when we're old and wrinkled
You gave me a kiss and a smile, a "yes, i will be yours"

So i'll never mind much giving you my love, i'll get even more of you...

Honey, know i meant it when i said i do
Long as i'm alive i'll fancy you
And our love may not look much like hollywood's
But i'll love you with all my heart (by grace)

You said i do so i gave you my heart, i'll stand by you until death says we part
