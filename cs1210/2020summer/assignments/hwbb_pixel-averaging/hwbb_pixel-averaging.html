            <h1>HW bb &ndash; Pixel Averaging</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>In astronomy, people take pictures of objects they can see in the sky &dash; stars, planets, galaxies,
                Klingons, etc. Unfortunately, due to the distance of these objects, the pictures are often grainy and
                noisy. In order to compensate for this noise problem, photographers will sometimes take multiple
                pictures of the same object in quick succession and then process all of those images to create a final,
                noise-free image. We'll call this process <strong><em>Pixel Averaging</em></strong>.</p>

            <h3>What is Pixel Averaging?</h3>
            <p>The light from distance stars, nebula, and other objects in the sky is very dim when it finally arrives
                here on Earth. The Earth's atmosphere can affect image quality. Camera hardware can be quirky at times.
                All of these problems add up to create noisy images. Pixel Averaging is a simple algorithm to overcome
                these issues and create good output from not-so-good input.</p>

            <p>The trick to making Pixel Averaging work is to capture multiple photos of a single object. Because of the
                issues mentioned above, each of these photos will be noisy. It turns out that this noise can be removed
                by averaging all of the noisy images together into one final high-quality image.</p>

            <p>How it works: An image is basically a big two-dimensional grid. We can think of each pixel in an image
                having an (<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) coordinate. Suppose we have <em>n</em> noisy images, all with the
                same height and width. Then each image <em>i</em>, where <em>i</em> is from 1 to <em>n</em>, has the
                same set of pixel coordinates. Since all the images have the same coordinates, we can go through
                each image, pixel-by-pixel, and access the <em>same pixel location</em> in each image. For each pixel
                location,
                we need to look at all of the noisy input images and calculate the average red, green, and blue values.
                These averages will be used for that pixel location in the clean image.
            </p>

            <h3>Data Sets</h3>

            <p>
                A photographer has given you image data for 4 astronomical objects that she would like you to process.
                For each object, she took
                10 photographs and placed them in a directory named raw_images. The contents of that directory can be <a
                    href="raw_images.zip">downloaded here</a>. All of the photographs are very noisy. For example,
                here is one of the photographs of the Interstellar Bubble N44F: <br>
            </p>
            <img style="margin-left:10%" src="n44f_01.jpeg" alt="noisy image of the Interstellar Bubble N44F">
            <br><br>
            <p>
                The photographer would like you to process the images and create final images that are much higher in
                quality.
            </p>

            <p>
                For example, if you look in the <b><em>n44f</em></b> folder, you will find these files:

            <ul style="padding-left: 4em;">
                <li>n44f/n44f_01.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_02.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_03.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_04.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_05.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_06.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_07.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_08.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_09.jpeg</li>
                <li>n44f/n44f_10.jpeg</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                All of the images within an image set are the same size, but different image sets have different sizes.
                So all the images for <b><em>n44f</em></b>
                are the same size, but the images in the <b><em>cone_nebula</em></b>, <em><strong>orion</strong></em>,
                and <b><em>wfc3_uvis</em></b> directories may be different.
            </p>

            <h3>Your Task</h3>
            <p>Ask the user for an image set to process, and then process the images in that directory, averaging their
                pixels to create the final image. For example, if the user asked you to process the
                <em><strong>n44f</strong></em> image set, you would read all the files in that directory, create the
                final image
                <em><strong>n44f_clean.jpeg</strong></em>, and store it in the <strong><em>n44f</em></strong> directory.
            </p>



            <h2>Assignment</h2>
            <p>Write a Python program that provides the text-based menu shown below that allows the user to select which
                image set to process. Once selected, your program should process the images as described above.
                <code><pre>
                    Which image set do you want to process?
                    1) cone_nebula  (The Cone Nebula - NGC 2264)
                    2) n44f  (Interstellar Bubble N44F)
                    3) orion  (The Orion Nebula)
                    4) wfc3_uvis  (Carina Nebula)

                 Selection: 

                </pre></code>
            </p>


            <h3>File Names &amp; Location</h3>
            <p>
                The data files should be stored in the separate <code>raw_images</code> folder. Just download and unzip
                the raw_images dataset and save the resulting folder with your program.
            </p>

            <p>
                The name of your program must be <code>pixelAveraging.py</code>.
            </p>


            <h3>Program Demo</h3>
            Here is a short video showing how your program should work: <a
                href="https://youtu.be/_GvadjBSL5o">youtu.be/_GvadjBSL5o</a>

            <h3>Grading</h3>
            <p>
                Please review the <a href="../../rubric.html">Grading Rubric for Programming Assignments</a>. I would
                especially like to draw your attention to the Documentation section which describes the header
                information that should be included at the beginning of your program.
            </p>

            <h3>What to Turn In / Required File Name</h3>

            <p>
                A Dropbox Folder has been created for this assignment in ICON. Please submit your Python program through
                ICON using that folder.<br>Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> upload that data files with your program. Only
                upload
                your python program.
            </p>
