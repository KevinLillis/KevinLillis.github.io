      <h2>Grading Criteria</h2>
      <h3>Program Specifications / Correctness</h3>
      <p>This is the most important criterion. A program must meet its specifications and function correctly. This means
        that it behaves as desired, producing the correct output, for a variety of inputs. (In CS:1210 we will be
        lenient with regards to producing correct output for <em>all</em> inputs, as we may not always have the tools
        needed to accomplish that, yet). This criterion includes the need to meet specifications by writing a program in
        a particular way or using a particular language feature, if such a thing is mentioned in the problem.</p>

      <p>If a specification is ambiguous or unclear, you have two choices: You can either make a reasonable assumption
        about what is required, based on what makes the most sense to you, or you can ask the instructor. If you make an
        assumption about an ambiguous specification, you should mention that somewhere in a comment so that the
        reader/grader knows what you were thinking. Points may be taken off for poor assumptions, however.</p>

      <h3>Readability</h3>
      <p>Code needs to be readable to both you and a knowledgeable third party. This involves:
      <ul style="padding-left: 4em;">
        <li>Using indentation consistently (e.g., every function's body is indented to the same level)</li>
        <li>Adding whitespace (blank lines, spaces) where appropriate to help separate distinct parts of the code (e.g.,
          space after commas in lists, blank lines between functions or between blocks of related lines within
          functions, etc.)</li>
        <li>Giving variables meaningful names. Variables named <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code> or
          <code>foo</code>, <code>bar</code>, <code>baz</code>, and <code>qux</code> give the reader no information
          whatsoever about their purpose or what information they may hold. Names like <code>principal</code>,
          <code>maximum</code>, and <code>counter</code> are much more useful. Loop variables are a common exception to
          this idea, and loop variables named <code>i</code>, <code>j</code>, <code>k</code> etc. are OK.</li>
        <li>The code should be well organized. Functions should be defined in one section of the program, code should be
          organized into functions so that blocks of code that need to be reused are contained within functions to
          enable that, and functions should have meaningful names. This is a concept that we will be learning about as
          we write more and more code in CS:1210, and so few points, if any, will be taken off for organization issues
          that we have not yet addressed in class.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Documentation</h3>
      <p>Every file containing code should start with a header comment. At the very least, this header should contain
        the the following:
      <ul style="padding-left: 4em;">
        <li>Your Name</li>
        <li>The name of the file</li>
        <li>The course number</li>
        <li>The homework assignment number</li>
        <li>A description of what the code does</li>
        <li>If needed, a more detailed description of the approach used in the code if it is complex or may be
          misunderstood, or references to resources that you used to help you write it.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>All code should also be well-commented. This requires striking a balance between commenting everything, which
        adds a great deal of unneeded noise to the code, and commenting nothing, in which case the reader of the code
        (or you, when you come back to it later) has no assistance in understanding the more complex or less obvious
        sections of code. In general, aim to put a comment on any line of code that you might not understand yourself if
        you came back to it in a month without having thought about it in the interim. Like code organization,
        appropriate commenting is also something we will be learning about as we write code throughout the semester, so
        while corrections may be made, points will only be taken off for things that have been emphasized in class
        already.</p>
      <p><a href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/misc/python_style_guide.html">This style guide</a>
        from CalTech has some good guidelines for writing comments, especially starting <a
          href="http://courses.cms.caltech.edu/cs11/material/python/misc/python_style_guide.html#COMMENTS_FULL_SENTENCES">here</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>Code Efficiency</h3>
      <p>There are often many ways to write a program that meets a particular specification, and several of them are
        often poor choices. They may be poor choices because they take many more lines of code (and thus your effort and
        time) than needed, or they may take much more of the computer's time to execute than needed. For example, a
        certain section of code can be executed ten times by copying and pasting it ten times in a row or by putting it
        in a simple <code>for</code> loop. The latter is far superior and greatly preferred, not only because it makes
        it faster to both write the code and read it later, but because it makes it easier for you to change and
        maintain.</p>

      <!--
<h3>Assignment Specifications</h3>
<p>Assignments will usually contain specifications and/or requirements outside of the programming problems themselves. For example, the way you name your files to submit them to the course website will be specified in the assignment. Other instructions may be included as well, so please read the assignments carefully.</p>
